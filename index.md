## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">
I obtained a Master Degree in computer science from the Korea University with a focus on a NLP such as dialog system and sequence labeling problems. My advisor is Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=HMTkz7oAAAAJ&amp;hl=ko&amp;oi=ao">Heuiseok Lim</a>. After MS degree, I'm working at Kakao corporation. Recently, I'm working on a dialogue summarization and dialogue response selection.
