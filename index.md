## Dongyub (Jude) Lee | U.S. Green Card Holder

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">
I am a computer scientist and AI researcher with a deep expertise in natural language processing (NLP) and the engineering of practical AI systems. I am currently working at the U.S. subsidiary of Naver, a leading Korean tech company. I've been deeply involved in enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) utilizing feedback learning methods. Before joining Naver, I served as an AI research engineer at Kakao Corporation, where I developed my expertise in NLP, particularly in task-oriented and open-domain dialogue systems.
